# MNS_CD
This is the Cluster Dynamics code for evolution of Mn-Ni-Si in low-Cu RPV steels
This readme file will include information for 1)solver information 2)input parameters to run code 3)explanation of output from code
1) Solver information
   The solver used in this code is SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinearand DIfferential/ALgebraic Equation Solvers), which can be downloaded from website: https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials. And more detail information about SUNDIALS can also be found from the website above. The module we used here is cvode.
2) Input parameters to run code
   Two kinds of parameters are needed. 
   One is the all physical parameters needed for the evolution of precipitates, including temperature, irradiation flux, precipitate phase and matrix information et al. All of these paramters are defined in Input.cpp.
   The other is the parameters affecting the numerical stability of the code and output file, including the maximum cluster size, cutoff size, method to calculate mean radius, running time et al. All of these parameters are defined in Constants.h. Two parameters that we would like to explain more here is runs and RadiusCalc.
   runs: Total output times, the corresponding irradiation time for each value of runs is given at the end of this file
   RadiusCalc: According to different need, two ways of calculating mean radius are provided. If r_i is the radius of each cluster with size i, N_i is the number density of each cluster with size i, radM1 means the mean radius are calculated via function mean radius= sum(r_i*N_i)/sum(N_i). And radM2 means the mean size of each phase are calculated first with equation MeanSize=sum(i*N_i)/sum(N_i), then the mean radius is radius corresponding to a cluster with size MeanSize.
3) Explanation of output from code
   There will be a total of five output files generated by the code, namely Output, Profile_0, Profile_1, Profile_2, Profile_3
   Output contains information of mean radius, number density of each phase (both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleated) at different irradiation fluences.
   Profile_0 contains particle size distribution of homogeneous nucleated T3 phase 
   Profile_1 contains particle size distribution of homogeneous nucleated T6 phase 
   Profile_2 contains particle size distribution of heterogeneous nucleated T3 phase 
   Profile_3 contains particle size distribution of heterogeneous nucleated T6 phase
